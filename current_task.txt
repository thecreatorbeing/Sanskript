Tasks:

 1) take code stream as a string from the file. (done!)

 2) break code stream into vector of vectors of strings having statements and blocks. (done!)
 
 3) break the tree of strings into CodeType objects by linearly parsing them and dividing them into different 'Type' enum. (basic part done/advance part pending!)
	
	forward declare C++ source code classes, functions, variables, etc. so that they get added in the symbol table respectively.

 4) Generate the relevant CPP code using generateCPP() functions.(*WORKING!)

 

 12 + addNum(2,5) * var1; -> * ( + ( 12 addNum(2,5) ) var1 ) or ( (12 addNum(2,5) + var1 ) *

 Future Updates:
 1]. add memory address of variables in symbol table as well, this will help for better identification of them, if possible then do the same for functions as well
 2]. comments must not start within any statement, must start after semicolon ';' so that unexpected behavior is avoided
